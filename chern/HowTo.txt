Sim makes 2 file one with eigenvalues one with eigenvectors.
the Process file takes these and makes a text file called new.dat with just
eigenvalues and kx values. 
the splitfile just takes the top and bottom half of new.dat and makes new .dat
files.

i've made a makefile that does all this for us so just type make and we are
good

you can go into gnuplot and use the command 
plot "new.dat" using 2:1
using 2:1 just tells it what the x and y axis should be.
